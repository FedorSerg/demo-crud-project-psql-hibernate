## Tasks with low level complexity

### Task 3

Build a __RESTful API__ for a simple social media application using __Spring Boot__, __Hibernate__, and __PostgreSQL__.
The application should allow users to create and view posts, follow other users, and like posts.
Each post should have a title, body, and author.
Use __Hibernate__ to persist the post and user data in the database.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- There are all the required codes and configs in the repository to run the application.
- There is a readme.md file with the application description and instructions on how to run it.
- Code is of good quality and easy to read and understand.
- There are unit tests in place, coverage >80%
- There are quality checks (coverage, complexity, check style)
- ChatGPT conversation logs are attached in the file chat.log
- Short feedback for each task added to readme.md in the following format:
  - Was it easy to complete the task using AI?
  - How long did task take you to complete? (Please be honest, we need it to gather anonymized statistics)
  - Was the code ready to run after generation? What did you have to change to make it usable?
  - Which challenges did you face during completion of the task?
  - Which specific prompts you learned as a good practice to complete the task?
